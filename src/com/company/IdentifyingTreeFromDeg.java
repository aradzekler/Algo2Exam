// Java program to check whether input degree
// sequence is graph or tree

/**
 * The degree of a vertex is given by the number of edges incident or leaving from it.
 * This can simply be done using the properties of trees like â€“
 *
 * Tree is connected and has no cycles while graphs can have cycles.
 * Tree has exactly n-1 edges while there is no such constraint for graph.
 * It is given that the input graph is connected. We need at least n-1 edges to connect n nodes.
 * O(n)
